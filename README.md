   When I was starting this project, I was unsure whether will I be able to complete it. I am just happy that I was able to complete it finally. API was new to me in this project.This task itself was like a small internship compared to the knowledge I gained in it.
    To the question, How it demonstrates my proficiency? I would say, a good programmer is a quick learner and I just learnt many concepts in this task. 

c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.
    
   I would do look into the Test cases that were optional in the tasks. I have done test cases in Java but I wonder how does test cases look here. 

d. Feedbacks:
    It's been a great pleasure working on this project. Thank you for your time and effort into recruitment.
